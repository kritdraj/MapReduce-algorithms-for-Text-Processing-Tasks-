# MapReduce-algorithms-for-Text-Processing-Tasks-

Performed three text processing tasks- Word count, N most frequent n-grams, and Inverted Index, to understand and implement the Hadoop framework. The Guternberg dataset containing three text files were used to implement map reduce algorithms to perform each task.
